How to use code

2D Holographic Reconstruction:

1) IntensityProfile.m -> for the study of the intensity pattern as recorded by the CCD camera
2) fresnelReconstrucion.m -> the numerical transformation of in phase space to real space of the
   development of the holographic reconstruction

   I_ref = reference intensity pattern without the presence of the obejct to be reconstruction
   coin5 = intensity pattern as reflected by the surface to be reconstructed
   * plane wave approximations yielded better results
  
Digital Tomography/3D Holographic Reconstruction:

1) IntensityProfile.m -> for the study of the intensity pattern as recorded by the CCD camera
2) 13AngleTomography_0.09.m -> tomography performed at a 0.09 m distance between rotated object in 13
   angles and the CCD camera

   referenceBeamIntensityProfile = intensity pattern without 3D object present
   combinedBeanProfile = intensity pattern when 3D object is present
   13AngleTomography_0.09 = best reconstruction result obtained
   pic0,,15,30,45,60,75,90,105,120,135,150,165,180 = different angles used to scan the 3D object
